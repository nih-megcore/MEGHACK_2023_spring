## Eyetracking v ground truth
(No Lead Currently) <br>
-- Eye tracking data will be collected in the next week or two <br>
-- Objective - Minimize the average error between the on-screen eye fixation mark and calculated eye location <br>
-- Fork this repository: https://github.com/nih-megcore/nih_to_mne.git <br>
---- Use this as a base file for ideas: nih2mne/eyetracking_preprocessing.py <br>

## Statistical Group analysis
(No Lead Currently) <br>
-- Use the HV data: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004215/versions/1.0.2  <br>
-- Some of the datasets will be pre-processed to source activations <br>
-- Use the online pages to calculate group statistics on the data: https://mne.tools/stable/statistics.html <br>

## Reaction time v activation
(No Lead) <br>
-- HV data can be used and will be prepped <br>
-- Assess reaction time versus stimulus time <br>
-- Regress stimulus time versus activation over group data <br>
